# HTML + JS only button example

This is an example repo on how you can create a button that posts data to a bagpipes scenario and returns the response. In this example the user is querying a pallet on polkadot with an address as input. 

## Bagpipes scenario:
![Bagpipes scenario](/images/bps.png)


## Button: 
Display the html file:
